/*Is gewoon 108 rows bc union gets rid of duplicates*/


--2 Write 2 sql queries and combine them using the set operator union all. First query should get all 
--employees and second should also get all employees. Check the amount of rows returned. Whatâ€™s the difference between union and union all?
select *
from EMPLOYEES
union ALL
select *
from EMPLOYEES;

/*216 rows omdat union all does not get rid of duplicates. Also union all is ook niet gesorteerd*/

--Je krijgt die 4800 in deze query niet, omdat die intersect gemeenschappelijke values **tussen** die 2 queries wilt ophalen
--Die 4800 komt gewoon 2 keer voor in die 2de query. Niet gemeenschappelijk tussen query one and query two
select salary from EMPLOYEES where JOB_ID='IT_PROG'
intersect
select SALARY from EMPLOYEES where JOB_ID='FI_ACCOUNT';
